 REAL ESTATE PRICE PREDICTION MODEL
-This project predicts real estate prices using a decision tree algorithm with Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

  Key Features:
1. Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and inconsistencies with Pandas and NumPy.
2. Visualization: Explored data distributions and feature relationships with Matplotlib.
3. Preprocessing: Scaled features and encoded categorical variables using Scikit-learn.
4. Modeling: Built a decision tree model with 82% accuracy.
5. Evaluation: Assessed model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

  Tools and Libraries Used:
1. Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation.
2. NumPy for numerical computations.
3. Matplotlib for data visualization.
4. Scikit-learn for preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.
